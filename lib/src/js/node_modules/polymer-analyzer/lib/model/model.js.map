The naming scheme is based on\n * the stage of the processing pipeline that an object is produced by.\n *\n * The pipeline looks like:\n *   load: reads in bytes from filesystem/network\n *   parse: convert bytes to abstract syntax trees\n *   scan: extract entirely local features from a single ast\n *   resolve: integrate cross-file information to produce the final result\n *\n * Importantly, we can cache everything before `resolve` at the file level,\n * making incremental analysis efficient.\n *\n * Because the output of the resolve phase is the API that will get the most\n * use, its results have clear, unprefixed names. So a resolved document is just\n * a Document, a resolved element is an Element.\n *\n * Earlier stages have the longer names, like ParsedDocument and ScannedElement.\n */\n\nexport * from './document';\nexport * from './element';\nexport {ElementReference, ScannedElementReference} from './element-reference';\nexport * from './event';\nexport * from './feature';\nexport * from './import';\nexport * from './inline-document';\nexport * from './literal';\nexport * from './property';\nexport * from './package';\nexport * from './resolvable';\nexport * from './source-range';\n"]}
